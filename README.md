# Harpett
Harpett.com was a MeteorJS application used to generate algorithmic questions for college students, specifically business majors.


There are three iterations of this application:
1) A static website where the JavaScript logic sat on the client side
2) An initial MeteorJS app where I learned how to use Meteor and full stack web development
3) A fully built MVP deployed on Modulus.io (which shut down Dec 31, 2016)


I was unable to generate traction on the project and decided it was time to move on.  

Code is here for sharing purposes - I think it was (and still is) a great idea, but was unable to execute on it.
